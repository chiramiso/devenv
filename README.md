# Devenv: Flexible Development Environment with Docker and Makefiles

## Overview

**Devenv** is a flexible, Docker-based development environment that allows you to manage multiple programming projects without installing languages or tools directly on your machine. Each project has its own Dockerfile for specific dependencies while sharing a common development container for tools like Vim, Tmux, and Git. A centralized Makefile streamlines commands for building, running, and managing projects.

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize a New Project

Create a new project structure with all necessary files and folders:

```bash
make init new-app
```

This creates the following structure in `~/Code/new-app/`, including starter scripts and Dockerfile.

### 2. Set Up Project Symlinks

Run the setup script to create symlinks for all or some projects in the parent directory:

```bash
make setup
```

Alternatively, you can link a specific project manually:

```bash
make link new-app path=/path/to/new-app
```

### 3. Build the Project

Build the projectâ€™s base and development Docker images:

```bash
make build new-app
```

### 4. Run the Project

Start the container in detached mode, optionally specifying a custom port:

```bash
make start new-app
# or specify a port
make start new-app PORT=8080
```

### 5. Access an Interactive Shell

Get a shell inside the development container for the project:

```bash
make shell new-app
```

### 6. Run Tests & Linting

Run the test and linter scripts defined in `scripts/test.sh` and `scripts/lint.sh`:

```bash
make test new-app
make lint new-app
```

### 7. View Logs

Follow logs from the running container:

```bash
make logs new-app
```

### 8. Stop the Project

Stop the running container gracefully using the projectâ€™s `scripts/stop.sh` script:

```bash
make stop new-app
```

### 9. Clean Up Volumes

Remove Docker volumes associated with the project (if any are used for persistent data):

```bash
make clean_volumes new-app
```

### 10. Purge the Project

Purge all Docker containers and images related to the project:

```bash
make purge new-app
```

## Docker Compose Setups

The `docker-setups/` directory contains Docker Compose configurations for multi-container applications. Each setup is organized in its own subdirectory:

```
docker-setups/
â”œâ”€â”€ example-setup/         # Example multi-container setup
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ my-mighty-app/         # my-mighty-app integration setup
    â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
```

### Managing Docker Compose Setups

#### Starting a Setup
```bash
make up setup-name
# Example: make up my-mighty-app
```
This command starts all containers defined in `docker-setups/setup-name/docker-compose.yml` in detached mode.

#### Stopping a Setup
```bash
make down setup-name
# Example: make down my-mighty-app
```
This command stops and removes all containers defined in the setup's docker-compose file, but preserves volumes.

### Container Interaction Commands

#### Accessing Container Shell
```bash
make tap container-name
# Example: make tap my-mighty-app
```
Opens an interactive shell in a running container. Will try `/bin/bash` first, then fall back to `/bin/sh`.

#### Viewing Container Logs
```bash
make taplog container-name
# Example: make taplog my-mighty-app
```
Shows the live logs of a running container in follow mode.

### Creating New Setups

1. Create a new directory in `docker-setups/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir docker-setups/my-setup
   ```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```bash
   touch docker-setups/my-setup/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Define your services in the docker-compose file. You can reference projects from the `projects/` directory using relative paths:
   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       build: ../../projects/my-project
       volumes:
         - ../../projects/my-project:/app
   ```

4. Start your setup:
   ```bash
   make up my-setup
   ```

## Environment Configuration

- **.env:** Define environment-specific variables in this file. It will be automatically loaded when running the container.
- **.env.example:** Template for the `.env` file, useful for sharing environment configurations without exposing sensitive data.

---

## Customization

### Adding Dependencies

Modify the project-specific `Dockerfile` to install language-specific dependencies. For example, in `~/Code/new-app/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
```

### Modifying Start/Stop/Test Scripts

Customize `scripts/start.sh`, `scripts/stop.sh`, `scripts/test.sh`, and `scripts/lint.sh` to define how your project starts, stops, runs tests, or lints code.

Example `start.sh` for a Node.js app:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm start
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Override Ports

You can override the default port (3000) when starting the container:

```bash
make start new-app PORT=5000
```

### Rebuild Without Cache

To rebuild the Docker images without using the cache:

```bash
make rebuild new-app
```

### Add Global Tools

To add global tools like Vim, Tmux, or Git to all projects, modify the `~/Code/devenv/Dockerfile`.

Example:

```dockerfile
ARG BASE_IMAGE=debian:latest
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y vim tmux git && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /code
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```
